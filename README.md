# Advent of Code 2022 in Clojure

This is the first Advent of Code that I did at my spare time after AoC
2022 competition has long passed.

The code is in Clojure and expected to be run and tested in the
REPL. It's not optimal. It may be not as idiomatic as it could have
been. It's written for fun.
